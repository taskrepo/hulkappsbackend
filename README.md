# :notebook_with_decorative_cover:  How I approached this problem:

I approached the project with a combination of enthusiasm and focus. As a full-stack developer, I was excited to tackle the challenge of creating a backend and frontend application with a range of functionalities such as user registration, login, logout, post creation, commenting, pagination, and post editing and deletion.

I particularly enjoyed the process of bringing the various components together and watching the project come to life. One aspect I appreciated was the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to create a user-friendly and seamless experience for the end-user.

However, I did face some challenges along the way, particularly in ensuring the smooth integration of the frontend and backend. I was able to overcome these challenges through effective troubleshooting and by seeking guidance from more experienced colleagues when necessary.

In total, I estimate that the completion of the project took approximately 20 hours, spread out over several days. Despite the time constraints, I am proud of the end result and the opportunity to demonstrate my passion for software development.
